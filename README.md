# 460_Plane_Seating_Algorithm

CODE DESCRIPTION:
------------
This Python project implements a smart airline seat allocation algorithm 
that prioritizes seating paid (priority) passengers in designated seats 
and groups families together either side-by-side or front-to-back, based 
on their last names. The algorithm is greedy and uses a min-heap to 
efficiently handle seat assignments. This algoritm will have the priority 
customers sit towards the front of the plane and by the window/aisle seats.
Famlies will then be placed accordingly based on their last name. This 
algorithm will be randomize all of the passengers accordingly and give a 
clear visual of the passengers and where they are placed on the plane. 

INSTALLATION & USAGE:
----------------------
1. Make sure Python 3.7 is installed
2. Save the project file as "main.py" in a folder of your choice.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to that folder.
4. Run the program by writing this command: "main.py"
5. Finally the output of the seating chart and the lists of the
   passengers will show.

INPUTS FOR PASSENGERS:
----------------------
In the code, there is a list of passengers that I came up with. These can
be changed to anything for tests. Along with that, there is either "True" 
or "False" next to their name indicating if they are a priority passenger
or not. Change this with however you would like to see the results of any
test you would like to see.
